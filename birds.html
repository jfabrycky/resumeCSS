    <p>The snowy owl a rare winter owl that regularly visits the midwest, and especially the lakefront, every winter. They breed on the arctic tundra,
      and only juveniles come south during the winter. Adults usually stay in the far north during the winter. Adult males are pure white, but juveniles
      are spotted, like the one shown in my photograph. I took this picture at the 31st Street Beach harbor. I suppose the owls like this site because
      docks are locked during the winter, giving them plenty of distance from people, and during the night they can hunt in burnham park, which certainly
      is prime habitat for rodents, their chief source of food. </p>

    <p>The lapland longspur is a northern finch which usually migrates through during spring and fall. These two were out of season, at 31st Street Beach,
      and were attracting a considerable birding crowd.</p>

    <iframe src="images/red_shouldered_hawk.png" height="400" width="600" allowfullscreen class="birdpic"></iframe>
    <p>The red shouldered hawk is a rare breeder in the chicago area, but a common spring and fall migrant. I found this one at Washington Park.</p>
    <p class="month">April</p>
    <iframe src="images/ruby_crowned_kinglet.png" height="400" width="600"  allowfullscreen class="birdpic"></iframe>
    <p>The ruby crowned kinglet is an abundant migrant during the spring and fall, most common in late april and then late september. It is a diminutive bird,
      but has a forest-filling bubbly song. It breeds in the boreal forest and winters in the south. I saw this one at the McCormick Place Bird Sanctuary.  </p>
    <p class="month">May</p>
    <iframe src="images/brown_thrasher.png" height="400" width="600"  allowfullscreen class="birdpic"></iframe>
    <p>The brown thrasher is a common summer breeder in the Chicago area, but I find them easier to see during spring migration. I photographed this one at Washington Park. </p>
    <p class="month">June</p>
    <iframe src="images/mallard.png" height="400" width="600"  allowfullscreen class="birdpic"></iframe>
    <p>The mallard is a ubiquitous duck, being found in large numbers on all inland lakes and in lake michigan. This is a nice photo of a female adult mallard with chicks,
      taken at Washington Park. </p>
    <p class="month">July</p>
    <iframe src="images/sanderling.png" height="400" width="600"  allowfullscreen class="birdpic"></iframe>
    <p> The sanderling is a common migrant sandpiper, found exclusively on beaches along the shore. It breeds in the boreal forest and winters in the gulf of mexico.
      It is usually found in April and May in the spring, and anywhere from July through November in the fall. </p>
    <p class="month">August</p>

    <p class="month">September</p>
    <iframe src="images/red_knot.png" height="400" width="600"  allowfullscreen class="birdpic"></iframe>
    <p> This is a very rare sandpiper which stopped at the Montrose protected beach. I was lucky to be able to photograph it and view it up close (about 15 feet away). This is
    the only bird in this list which is not seen every year in Cook County. </p>
